            <p>Hi, my name is Evan. I'm a junior from Hillsdale Highschool. I've been programming for almost three years now. I have coding experience in C, Java, Python, and HTML&CSS. I'm have been on back-end for most of the time and I figured that front-end is just as important. This course is the first front-end class I've taken, and I'm really excited to learn more about it.</p>

        <p>For the past two years, I've been forcusing on the back-end part of coding and is now working on data structure and algorithms. During last winter, I tried building an app and realized that I lack front-end skills. Therefore, I'm now here taking my first front-end course.</p>
